# Welcome to Concorde Elements Storybook 

The UI Elements library [(Gitlab)](https://gitlab.com/e-pilot/product/journey/journey-monorepo/-/tree/main/packages/concorde-elements) is part of journeys UI. 
It uses CSS Modules as a main CSS tool and [Material Symbols](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/material_symbols) for icons. 

Happy building! We hope this library makes your development experience smoother and more enjoyable.
